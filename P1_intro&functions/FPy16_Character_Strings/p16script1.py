# How many symbols are in the following character string?

# Using the objects in an F-string, print "Our staff member Catherine Gaskin currently has 36 patients."


# When writing functions, feel free to rename the parameters!
# I will initiate only with i for "input".
# In real life, use meaningful names!!!!


# T3 ----
# Write a function taking a charstring as input.
# Does it start with a letter alphabetically before the letter m?
# Hint: you do not have to use a subset of the name.
# Note the order of lower and upper case letters in Python:
print("d" < "Z") # False, since "123" < "UPPER" < "lower"

    0
print("ifh1:", is_first_half("Ana")) # should be True
print("ifh2:", is_first_half("Rita")) # should be False


# T4 ----
# Write a function taking a charstring 'sentence' as input.
# Split the sentence into individual words (at spaces).
def sentence2words(i):
    0
print("s2w:", sentence2words("Python is cool.")) # should be ['Python', 'is', 'cool.']


# T5 ----
# Write a function that counts how often the letter p occurs in the input (regardless of case).
# Only a single character string will be given as input.
# Note that you can chain methods!
def num_pees(i):
    0
print("np:", num_pees("Python programming: Powerful when partnered with R")) # should be 4
