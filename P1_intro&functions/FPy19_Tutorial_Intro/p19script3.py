# The HIS should be able to manage drug prescriptions in different dosage units.
# Unit conversion: 1 Ounce = 28.3495 grams
# Write the function 'oz2g' that accepts weight in ounces as input and returns the weight in grams, rounded to 1 digit.
# No printing is required.


# T6 ----
# Compute the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b
# in mathematical notation: sqrt(a^2 + b^2)  <- this is NOT valid Python code
# Do not yet use the 'sqrt' function. Use only the + and ** operators (for practice).
# Assign the output to 'c' (code structure already included for your convenience).

a = 13
b = 8
c = 0
print(c)


# T7 ----
# Some functions in the HIS will need to log their usage in a file.
# Write the function 'log_class' that accepts an object as input and does two things:
# - It should _print_ "Object is valid: True" if the object is an integer, floating point number or complex number. 
# Otherwise it should print "Object is valid: False". 
# Hint: if-else conditional coding is NOT needed here.
# - It should _return_  the class of the object. Use the function you have learned about in class.
